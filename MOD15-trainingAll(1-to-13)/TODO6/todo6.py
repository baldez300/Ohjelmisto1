# Write a function that receives as parameters the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters
# and the price of the pizza in euros.
# The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza in euros per square meter.
# The main program asks the user for the diameters and prices of two pizzas
# and indicates which pizza gives better value for money (i.e. which one has a lower unit price).
# The written function must be used in the calculation of unit prices.
